# scop - 42 Project

This was my first time exploring graphic APIs, using Vulkan. I was also learning Rust within a structured project.

<!---
I have initiated a new personal project where I aim to apply my newly acquired knowledge with better structure and more functionality. You can follow my progress here: [scop2](https://github.com/SimonCROS/scop2)
-->

I will also begin a new graphics project for 42, called HumanGL, which will use OpenGL.

### Minimal Requirements for the Project:
- No use of external libraries (except for window handling, window events, and the graphics API)
- Parse basic .obj files
- Implement vectors and matrices
- Display a 3D object rotating around its middle axis
- Apply a basic texture (without UV mapping)
- Move the object along the x, y, and z axes using the keyboard

### Through this project, I gained an understanding of and practical experience with:
- Swapchain
- Command Pools
- Command Buffers
- Buffers
- Images
- Framebuffers
- Pipelines
- Render Passes
- Descriptors
- Linear and non-linear color spaces
- RenderDoc (for debugging)

This project has been a significant learning experience, deepening my understanding of graphics programming and Vulkan, while also allowing me to improve my Rust skills.
