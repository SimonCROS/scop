# scop - 42 Project

First time discovering graphic APIs, using Vulkan.\
I was also discovering Rust on a structured project.

I started a new personal project, in which I will be able to apply what I learned with better structure and more functionality.\
https://github.com/SimonCROS/scop2

I will also begin a new graphic project for 42, HumanGL (using OpenGL).

Minimal requirements for the project:
- No use of external libraries (except for window, window events and graphic API)
- Parse basic .obj files
- Implement vectors and matrices
- Display a 3D object, rotating around it's middle axis
- Basically apply a texture (without UV)
- Be able to move the object on x, y and z axis using keyboard.

This project allowed me to understand and use:
- Swapchain
- Command Pools
- Command Buffers
- Buffers
- Images
- Framebuffers
- Pipelines
- Render Passes
- Descriptors
- Linear and non-linear color spaces
- RenderDoc (for debug)
